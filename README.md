# Video Query

This repository provides the front-end deployment for the Video Query project. It uses [Angular 6.x](https://angular.io). 
The home page for the Video Query project is

[Video Query Home](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-home)

This front end calls the RESTful Video Query API, which uses Video Query Algorithms.
The API can be used independently as well, for video querying independent of this front end.
The code and documentation for the API and Algorithms are at

- [Video Query API](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api)
