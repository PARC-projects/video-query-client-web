Home page for Video Query project: **[Video Query Home](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-home)**


This repository provides the front-end deployment for the Video Query project. It uses [Angular 6.x](https://angular.io). 


This front end calls the RESTful Video Query API, which uses Video Query Algorithms.
The API can be used independently as well, for video querying independent of this front end.
The code and documentation for the API and Algorithms are at

- [Video Query API](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api)
- [Video Query Algorithms](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-algorithms)
