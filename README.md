# Video Query

This project serves as the front-end deployment to the Video Query application. It uses [Angular 6.x](https://angular.io).

This front end calls the RESTful Video Query API, which uses Video Query Algorithms.
The API can be used independently as well, for video querying independent of this front end.
The code and documentation for the API and Algorithms are at

- [Video Query API](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-api)
- [Video Query Algorithms](https://github.com/PARC-projects/video-query-algorithms)

For an overview of the Video Query project please see the reference [TBD arxiv pdf](https://arxiv.org/).
